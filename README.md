# 🍽️ Cravely

Cravely is a student-focused food discovery platform that helps college students find nearby restaurants and cafés offering their **desired dishes at the best prices**, powered by **dish-specific reviews from fellow students**.

Unlike traditional food apps that focus on restaurants as a whole, Cravely focuses on **what students actually care about**:
**Which dish should I order, where, and for how much?**
